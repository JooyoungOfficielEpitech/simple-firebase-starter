## Notes for Designers

This is a **redesign project** — treat all existing patterns as opportunities for improvement rather than constraints. Each document identifies:

- **Current patterns** (what exists now)
- **UX issues** (problems to solve)
- **Opportunities** (areas for enhancement)
- **Recommendations** (specific improvements)

Focus on creating an intuitive, delightful experience that serves both actors seeking opportunities and theatre companies recruiting talent.
